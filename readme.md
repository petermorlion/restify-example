# restify-example

This is a simple Restify example to accompany a blog post.
It includes a Postman collection that you can use to call
the API. You'll have to manually copy-paste some idea's
between the different calls though.

## Usage

Make sure Node.js is installed and then run:

```
npm install
node .
```

You can now call the server at `http://localhost:8080`.
